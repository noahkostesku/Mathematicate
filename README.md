The inspiration behind this project was a math youtuber known as 3Blue1Brown. Math can sometimes be hard to grasp. While going through some of 3Blue1Brown's videos, having a unique visual and interpretation of a problem provided additonal insight and further understanding, which motivated me to do the same. 

The following animations made in this project were made using manim (python library), an animation engine for explanatory math videos created by Grant Sanderson or 3Blue1Brown.
